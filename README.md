# Contractor Check List
When I recently decided to start AutoLogic and enter the world of contracting, there was a lot I didn't know about. This ignorance ranged from setting up a limited company, right through to indemnity insurance and what it's about. I'm hoping this simple list will help anyone else looking to get into the field of contracting.

## Disclaimer

None of the advice here is legal advice. Anything to do with cash flow, taxes, contracts, or other legal matters should be discussed with the relevant professionals in the relevant fields.

## UK Contractors
This guide/list is mainly aimed at people in the UK. It covers registering a UK based limited company and UK based services. 

## The Rundown

These are considered the minimum steps one should take to get a business up and running. 

- Register a limited company via Companies House
    - Â£15 at the time of writing
    - Takes 20 minutes and is all online
    - Certificate of Incorporation comes in via email (PDF)
- Get a "virtual office" or mail forwarding service
    - Keep your residential address off of public record
    - Use it for the registered and service address
    - Make sure it includes mail forwarding for non-government mail, such as bank related mail
- Get a business bank account
    - This can take upwards of 20-30 **working** days
    - The process generally involves a call from the bank 
- Wait for your letter from HMRC containing your tax reference
    - This takes upwards of two weeks
    - You can't do anything tax related without this
    - Companies House will initiate this with HMRC
- Register for Corporation Tax
- Register for Value Added Tax (if applicable)
- Register for Payroll (if applicable - most likely)
