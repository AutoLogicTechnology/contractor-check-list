# Contractor Check List
When I recently decided to start AutoLogic and enter the world of contracting, there was a lot I didn't know about. This ignorance ranged from setting up a limited company, right through to indemnity insurance what it's about. I'm hoping this simple list will help anyone else looking to get into the job.

## UK Contractors
This guide/list is mainly aimed at people in the UK. It covers registering a UK based limited company and UK based services. 

## A General List

- Register a limited company via Companies House
 - Â£15 at the time of writing
- Get a "virtual office" or mail forwarding service
 - Keep your residential address off of public record
 - Use it for the registered and service address
 - Make sure it includes mail forwarding for non-government mail, such as bank related mail
