# Contractor Check List
When I recently decided to start AutoLogic and enter the world of contracting, there was a lot I didn't know about. This ignorance ranged from setting up a limited company, right through to indemnity insurance and what it's about. I'm hoping this simple list will help anyone else looking to get into the field of contracting.

## Disclaimer

None of the advice here is legal advice. Anything to do with cash flow, taxes, contracts, or other legal matters should be discussed with the relevant professionals in the relevant fields.

## UK Contractors
This guide/list is mainly aimed at people in the UK. It covers registering a UK based limited company and UK based services. 

## The Rundown

These are considered the minimum steps one should take to get a business up and running. 

- Get a "virtual office" or mail forwarding service
- Register a limited company via Companies House
- Register for Corporation Tax
- Register for Value Added Tax (if applicable)
- Register for Payroll (if applicable - most likely) 
- Get a business bank account
- Get an indemnity insurance policy
- Find an accountant

## In Detail

The above is a rundown - a simple list - but here we go into a bit more detail on each step. We maintain lsit format to keep it simple to disgest and easy to follow.

### Virtual Office &amp; Mail Forwarding

- Keep your residential address off of public record
- Use it for the registered and service address
- Make sure it includes mail forwarding for non-government mail, such as bank related mail

### Registering &amp; Companies House

- £15 at the time of writing
- Takes 20 minutes and is all online
- Certificate of Incorporation comes in via email (PDF)

## Registering for Taxes

Before you can register online for the varies taxes, you have to wait for HMRC to send you your Unique Tax Reference (**UTR**). Companies House will let HMRC know you've registered a company, and thus HMRC will send you a letter (or several) containing this reference and inviting you to sign up for paying taxes.

- This can all be done online using the government [Gateway](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/) system
- VAT registration is optional until a certain turn over is reached by your company
 - Consult HMRC for this threshold and other finer details
- Payroll is needed so you can submit payslips and pay Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and National Insurance (NI) contributions
- Corporation tax focuses on your companies' profits

### Business Bank Account

- This can take upwards of 20-30 **working** days
- The process generally involves a call from the bank 

### Indemnity Insurance

- Potentially a legal/contractual requirement (confirmation needed)
- Price is based on your business and income
- Your agency/contract might have specific requirements of your insurance. Check this out before purchasing
- Can range between £300 - £1,000+ per year

### Accountant

- Help with taxes
- Help with expenses and what you can and cannot claim
- Undestanding how and when to submit tax returns
- (See below regarding Freeagent)

### Letters

- Wait for your letter from HMRC containing your tax reference
- This takes upwards of two weeks
- You can't do anything tax related without this
- Companies House will initiate this with HMRC

## Optional Services &amp; Recommendations

These are additional steps and services you can utilise to help make your life easier.

- Register with the [PCG](https://www.pcg.org.uk)
    - Cheap
    - Added protection from tax investigations
    - Helplines
    - Networking
- Register a [Freeagent](https://freeagent.com) account to make your accountancy very simple
 - Provide it with access to the above tax systems
 - Hook it into your business bank account (if supported) for consolidattion of incoming and outgoing cash flow
 - STILL get an accountant. Freeagent doesn't replace or constitute a complete 100% legal framework (in my personal opinion). Freeagent has an [accountant search facility](http://www.freeagent.com/accountants/accountants)
 - Help us both out by using my referral code (10% discount): ` 43wr0t2g` ;-)
- Use [Moo](https://moo.com) to get some very fancy, professional business cards
